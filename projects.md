      alt: sand
    description: <br/> Developed a react application which allows users to view and compare various covid statistics from countries by querying data from a time series database using InfluxQL. Added user groups to faciliate admins to add data in database. <br/> <a href="https://github.com/hardiksiloiya/Covid_analyzer">Code</a>

  - title: Quad Trees for Sparse Matrix Compression
    image:
      src: /assets/img/work/quad.png
      alt: sand
    description: <br/> Implemented the quad tree data structure used for efficiently storing sparse binary matrices allowing compression of such images and matrices with functions to perform binary operations such as XOR, AND, OR.  <br/> <a href="https://github.com/hardiksiloiya/Quad-Tree">Code</a>

  - title: Anti Tic-Tac-Toe Solver
    image:
      src: /assets/img/work/tic.png
      alt: sand
    description: <br/> Built a Markov Decision Process (MDP) solver to find the optimal policy from any state for the game of Anti-Tac-Toe. <br/> <a href="https://github.com/hardiksiloiya/Anti-Tic-Tac-Toe">Code</a>

  - title: Image Splicing Detection
    image:
      src: /assets/img/work/splice.png
      alt: sand
    description: <br/> Leveraging inconsistencies in local noise variance, designed a technique to identify tampered images. <br/> <a href="https://github.com/hardiksiloiya/Image-Splicing-Detection">Code</a>
